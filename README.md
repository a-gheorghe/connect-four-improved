Connect Four with React

Connect Four is a game where each player tries to get 4 pieces of their own colour in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

In this repo, most of the logic for the game can be found in src/Components/Board.js. The other components in the Components folder are primarily presentational.

To run the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/a-gheorghe/connect-four-improved.git
cd connect-four-improved
npm i
npm start
--> localhost:3000
```
